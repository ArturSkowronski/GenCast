# Integration Tests

This directory contains integration tests that verify the complete functionality of the GenCast application with real internet connectivity and AI API integrations.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

**These tests are NOT run automatically** during the build process because they:
- Require internet connectivity
- Make actual API calls to OpenAI and/or Claude
- May incur costs for API usage
- Are dependent on external services

## Prerequisites

Before running the integration tests, ensure you have:

1. **Internet connectivity** - Tests fetch content from real websites
2. **API Keys** - At least one of the following environment variables set:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For OpenAI GPT integration
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - For Claude AI integration

## Running the Integration Test

To run the integration test manually:

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

This command will:
1. Compile the TypeScript code
2. Run the integration test
3. Display detailed results in the console

## What the Integration Test Covers

The integration test verifies:

### 1. Environment Setup
- ‚úÖ Checks if API keys are properly configured
- ‚úÖ Validates that at least one AI service is available

### 2. CSV Processing
- ‚úÖ Creates a temporary CSV file with test URLs
- ‚úÖ Tests reading and parsing CSV content
- ‚úÖ Validates URL extraction functionality

### 3. Article Content Fetching
- ‚úÖ Tests fetching content from real websites (BBC, Reuters, NPR)
- ‚úÖ Validates HTML parsing and content extraction
- ‚úÖ Ensures proper handling of different website structures

### 4. OpenAI Integration (if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set)
- ‚úÖ Tests OpenAI API connectivity
- ‚úÖ Validates GPT-3.5-turbo model usage
- ‚úÖ Confirms proper prompt formatting and response parsing

### 5. Claude Integration (if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set)
- ‚úÖ Tests Claude API connectivity
- ‚úÖ Validates Claude 3 Haiku model usage
- ‚úÖ Confirms proper prompt formatting and response parsing

## Expected Output

When running successfully, you should see output like:

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No API Keys Found**
   ```
   ‚ùå No API keys found. Please set OPENAI_API_KEY and/or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   ```
   **Solution**: Set at least one of the required environment variables

2. **Network Issues**
   ```
   ‚ùå Failed to fetch article content
   ```
   **Solution**: Check your internet connection and ensure the test URLs are accessible

3. **API Rate Limits**
   ```
   Error generating debriefing: Rate limit exceeded
   ```
   **Solution**: Wait a few minutes and try again, or check your API usage limits

### Setting Environment Variables

**For OpenAI:**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
```

**For Claude:**
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key-here"
```

**For permanent setup**, add these to your shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.)

## Cost Considerations

Running this test will make actual API calls and may incur small costs:
- OpenAI: ~$0.002 per test run (GPT-3.5-turbo)
- Claude: ~$0.0008 per test run (Claude 3 Haiku)

The test uses short content samples to minimize costs while still validating functionality.
